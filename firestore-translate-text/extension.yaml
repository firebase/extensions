      cost-effective). "Gemini (Google AI)" leverages Google's Gemini models via
      Google AI Studio for more accurate and context-aware translations
      (requires Gemini API access and API key). "Gemini (Vertex AI)" uses Gemini
      models through Vertex AI in your Google Cloud project (requires Vertex AI
      access).

      speed and cost.
