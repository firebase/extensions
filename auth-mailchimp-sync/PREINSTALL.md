Use this extension to add new users to an existing [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com) audience.

This extension adds the email address of each new user to your specified Mailchimp audience. Also, if the user deletes their user account for your app, this extension removes the user from the Mailchimp audience.

**Note:** To use this extension, you need to manage your users with Firebase Authentication.

This extension uses Mailchimp, so you'll need to supply your Mailchimp API Key and Audience ID when installing this extension.

#### Additional setup

You must also have a Mailchimp account before installing this extension.
