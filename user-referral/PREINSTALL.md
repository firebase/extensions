Use this mod to add "invite a friend" functionality so that your users can send invite emails to other people who aren't yet using your app.

This mod creates two callable functions - one that sends invitations via email and another that's triggered by the acceptance of an email invitiation (a conversion).

This mod sends emails using a required [SendGrid](https://SendGrid.com/) account, and keeps track of invites and conversions using Cloud Firestore.
