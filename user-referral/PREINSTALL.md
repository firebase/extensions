Use this extension to add "invite a friend" functionality so that your users can send invite emails to other people who aren't yet using your app.

This extension creates two callable functions - one that sends invitations via email and another that's triggered by the acceptance of an email invitiation (a conversion).

This extension sends emails using a required [SendGrid](https://SendGrid.com/) account, and keeps track of invites and conversions using Cloud Firestore.

When you use Firebase Extensions, you're only charged for the underlying resources that you use. Firebase Extensions themselves are free to use. All Firebase services offer a free tier of usage. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)
