Use this extension to add a highly scalable counter service to your app. This is ideal for applications that count viral actions or any very high-velocity action such as views, likes, or shares.

Since Cloud Firestore has a limit of one sustained write per second, per document, this extension instead shards your writes across documents in a `_counter_shards_` subcollection. Each client only increments their own unique shard while the background workers (provided by this extension) monitor and aggregate these shards into a main document.

Here are some features of this extension:

- Scales from 0 updates per second to a maximum of 10,000 per second.
- Supports an arbitrary number of counters in your app.
- Works offline and provides latency compensation for the main counter.

Note that this extension requires client-side logic to work. We provide a [TypeScript client sample implementation](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-counter/clients/web/src/index.ts) and its [compiled minified JavaScript](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-counter/clients/web/dist/sharded-counter.js). You can use this extension on other platforms if you'd like to develop your own client code based on the provided client sample.


#### Additional setup
