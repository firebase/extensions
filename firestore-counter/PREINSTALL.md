Use this extension to add a highly scalable counter service to your app. This is ideal for applications that count viral actions or any very high-velocity action such as views, likes, or shares.

Since Cloud Firestore has a limit of one sustained write per second, per document, this extension instead shards your writes across documents in a `_counter_shards_` subcollection. Each client only increments their own unique shard while the background workers (provided by this extension) monitor and aggregate these shards into a main document.

Here are some features of this extension:

- Scales from 0 updates per second to at least 10,000 per second.
- Supports an arbitrary number of counters in your app.
- Works offline and provides latency compensation for the main counter.

Note that this extension is currently fully resourced for use with JavaScript apps (we provide the required [JS SDK](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-counter/clients/web/src/index.ts)). You can, however, use this extension on other platforms if you'd like to develop your own API based on the provided JS SDK.


#### Additional setup

Before installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.

After installing this extension, you'll need to:

- Update your [database security rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules).
- Set up a [Cloud Scheduler job](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/quickstart) to regularly call the controllerCore function, which is created by this extension. It works by either aggregating shards itself or scheduling and monitoring workers to aggregate shards.
- Install the provided [Counter SDK](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-counter/clients/web/src/index.ts) in your app. You can then use this library in your code to specify your document path and increment values.

Detailed information for these post-installation tasks are provided after you install this extension.


#### Billing

This extension uses other Firebase or Google Cloud Platform services which may have associated charges:

- Cloud Firestore
- Cloud Functions

When you use Firebase Extensions, you're only charged for the underlying resources that you use. A paid-tier billing plan is only required if the extension uses a service that requires a paid-tier plan, for example calling to a Google Cloud Platform API or making outbound network requests to non-Google services. All Firebase services offer a free tier of usage. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)
