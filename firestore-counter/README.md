# Distributed Counter

**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)

**Description**: Records event counters at scale to accommodate high-velocity writes to Cloud Firestore.



**Details**: Use this extension to add a highly scalable counter service to your app. This is ideal for applications that count viral actions or any very high-velocity action such as views, likes, or shares.

Since Cloud Firestore has a limit of one sustained write per second, per document, this extension instead shards your writes across documents in a `_counter_shards_` subcollection. Each client only increments their own unique shard while the background workers (provided by this extension) monitor and aggregate these shards into a main document.

Here are some features of this extension:

- Scales from 0 updates per second to a maximum of 10,000 per second.
- Supports an arbitrary number of counters in your app.
- Works offline and provides latency compensation for the main counter.

Note that this extension requires client-side logic to work. We provide a [TypeScript client sample implementation](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-counter/clients/web/src/index.ts) and its [compiled minified JavaScript](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-counter/clients/web/dist/sharded-counter.js). You can use this extension on other platforms if you'd like to develop your own client code based on the provided client sample.


#### Additional setup

Before installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.

After installing this extension, you'll need to:

- Update your [database security rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules).
- Use the provided [client sample](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-counter/clients/web/src/index.ts) or your own client code to specify your document path and increment values.

Detailed information for these post-installation tasks are provided after you install this extension.


#### Billing
 
To install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)
 
- You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).
- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the serviceâ€™s free tier:
 - Cloud Firestore
 - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-24))



**Configuration Parameters:**

* Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).

* Document path for internal state: What is the path to the document where the extension can keep its internal state?

* Frequency for controllerCore function to be run: In minutes, how often should the function to aggregate shards be run?



**Cloud Functions:**

* **controllerCore:** This scheduled function either aggregates shards itself, or it schedules and monitors workers to aggregate shards.

* **onWrite:** Listens for changes on counter shards that may need aggregating. This function is limited to max 1 instance.

* **worker:** Monitors a range of shards and aggregates them, as needed. There may be 0 or more worker functions running at any point in time. The controllerCore function is responsible for scheduling and monitoring these workers.



**Access Required**:



This extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:

* datastore.user (Reason: Allows the extension to aggregate Cloud Firestore counter shards.)

* cloudscheduler.admin (Reason: Allows the extension to create a new Cloud Scheduler function.)
