Use this mod to add a highly scalable counter service to your application. This is ideal for applications that count viral actions or any very high velocity action such as views, likes, or shares.

This mod includes an SDK that lets you specify a path to a Firestore document and increment a field value by any amount you choose. A subcollection gets created on the document to help track the counter in a scalable way.

After installation the mod requires you to manually setup a scheduled function to help the counter function.
