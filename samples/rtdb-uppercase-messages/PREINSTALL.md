Use this extension to automatically convert strings to upper case when added to a specified Realtime Database path.

This extension expects a database layout like the following example:

    "messages": {
        MESSAGE_ID: {
            "original": MESSAGE_TEXT
        },
        MESSAGE_ID: {
            "original": MESSAGE_TEXT
        },
    }

When you create new string records, this extension creates a new sibling record with upper-cased
text:

    MESSAGE_ID: {
        "original": MESSAGE_TEXT,
        "upper": UPPERCASE_MESSAGE_TEXT,
    }
