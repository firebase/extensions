# Firebase Mods

This repository contains sample Firebase Mods. To install them, or to create one of your own, follow the instructions at [https://bit.ly/2GaFpr7](https://bit.ly/2GaFpr7).

Each directory contains the source code for a mod and a README to explain how that mod was made. **Please note that you should not be adding a README to your own mod during the Early Access Program to minimize risk of leakage.** Instructions that are relevant for the consumers of your mod should be in `PREINSTALL.md` and `POSTINSTALL.md`.
