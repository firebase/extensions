# Firebase Mods

This repository contains the source for Firebase Mods. Created and tested by Firebase, these official Firebase mods are reliable and secure. To learn more about Firebase Mods, including how to install them in your Firebase projects, visit the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/mods).

Each directory in this repo contains the source code for a mod and a README to explain how the mod works, including information about the APIs enabled, resources created, and the access granted to the mod.

When you find a mod that solves a need for your app or project, all you do is install and configure the mod. With mods, you don't spend time researching, writing, and debugging the code that implements functionality or automates a task for your app or project.

You can also browse official Firebase mods from the following sources:
* [Firebase Mods product page](https://firebase.google.com/products/mods)
* [Firebase Mods dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/mods/) in the Firebase console
