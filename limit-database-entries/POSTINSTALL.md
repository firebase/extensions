If the number of items at `${param:NODE_PATH}` exceeds the max count of `${param:MAX_COUNT}`, this mod deletes the oldest items first until there are `${param:MAX_COUNT}` items remaining.

We recommend adding data via pushing, for example `firebase.database().ref().child('posts').push()`, because pushing assigns an automatically generated ID to the item in the database. During retrieval, these items are guaranteed to be ordered by the time they were added. Learn more about reading and writing data for your platform (iOS, Android, or Web) in the [Realtime Database documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/).
