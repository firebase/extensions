this agreement simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to [https://cla.developers.google.com](https://cla.developers.google.com) to see

## Code and copy reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Community guidelines

This project follows [Google's Open Source Community
Guidelines](https://opensource.google.com/conduct/).

## Report an issue

Report all issues through GitHub Issues using the [Report a Bug](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/issues/new?template=bug.md) template.

To help resolve your issue as quickly as possible, read the template and provide all the requested information.

## File a feature request

We welcome all feature requests, whether it's to add new functionality to an existing extension or to offer an [idea for a brand new extension](https://firebase.google.com/support/troubleshooter/report/features/).

Here's how to submit a feature request for an existing extension:

1. File your feature request through GitHub Issues using the [Feature Request template](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/issues/new?template=fr.md).

1. File a new [Firebase support request](https://firebase.google.com/support/troubleshooter/report/features/) via the Firebase website. Make sure to reference your feature request's GitHub Issue in the support ticket.

## Create a pull request

When making pull requests to the repository, make sure to follow these guidelines for both bug fixes and new features:

- Before creating a pull request, file a GitHub Issue so that maintainers and the community can discuss the problem and potential solutions before you spend time on an implementation.
- In your PR's description, link to any related issues or pull requests to give reviewers the full context of your change.
- For commit messages, follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.
  - For example, if you update documentation for a specific extension, your commit message might be: `docs(extension-name) updated installation documentation`.
- For your PR to be merged:

  - You must sign the [Google Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/clas).
  - All tests must pass.

### Features

Before creating pull requests for new features, first file a GitHub Issue describing the reasoning and motivation for the feature. This gives maintainers and the community the opportunity to provide feedback on your idea before implementing it.
