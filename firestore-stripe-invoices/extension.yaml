    label: Invoices collection
    description: >-
      What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where you'll store your invoices?
    default: invoices
    required: true

  - param: STRIPE_API_KEY
    label: Stripe API key with restricted access
    description: >-
      What is your Stripe API key for sending invoices? 
      We recommend creating a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access)
      with write access only for the `customers` and `invoices` resources.
      If desired, you can optionally use a test mode API key for initial testing
      of your extension, but you'll need to later reconfigure your extension
      to use a live mode key. Learn more about API keys in your
      [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys).
    example: rk_live_1234567890
    required: true

  - param: DAYS_UNTIL_DUE_DEFAULT
    label: Days until payment is due
    description: >-
      What is the default number of days the customer has before their payment is due?
      The invoice automatically closes after this number of days.
      You can override this default value for each invoice.
    default: 7
    required: true

  - param: STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
    label: Stripe webhook secret
    description: >-
      This is your signing secret for a Stripe-registered webhook that updates
      each Cloud Firestore document with the invoice's status from the Stripe
      dashboard. This webhook can only be registered after installation.
      To use this optional feature, leave this value empty during installation,
      then follow the postinstall instructions for registering your webhook
      and configuring this value.
    example: whsec_1234567890
    required: false
