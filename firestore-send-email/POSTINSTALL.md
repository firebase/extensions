### See it in action

You can test out this extension right away!

1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.

1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.

1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:

    ```js
    to: ['someone@example.com'],
    message: {
      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',
      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',
      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',
    }
    ```

1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.

**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:

```js
admin
  .firestore()
  .collection("${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}")
  .add({
    to: "someone@example.com",
    message: {
      subject: "Hello from Firebase!",
      text: "This is the plaintext section of the email body.",
      html: "This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.",
    },
  })
  .then(() => console.log("Queued email for delivery!"));
```
