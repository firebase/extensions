When a user's account is deleted from your project's authenticated users, their data will be automatically deleted from your specified Realtime Database instance, Cloud Firestore instance, and/or Cloud Storage bucket.

## Try it out

Give this mod a try by adding then deleting test users in the
[Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/authentication/users).
