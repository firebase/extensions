When a user's account is deleted from your project's authenticated users, their data will be automatically deleted from your specified Cloud Firestore instance, Realtime Database instance, and/or Cloud Storage bucket.

### Try out your mod's configuration

Give this mod a try by adding then deleting test users in the
[Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/authentication/users).

As a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/mods/manage-installed-mods#monitor) of your installed mod, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.
