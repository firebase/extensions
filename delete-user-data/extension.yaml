    required: false
    description: >-
      Which paths in your Cloud Firestore instance contain user data? Leave empty if
      you don't use Cloud Firestore.

      Enter the full paths, separated by commas. You can represent the User ID of the deleted user with `{UID}`.

      For example, if you have the collections `users` and `admins`, and each collection
      has documents with User ID as document IDs, then you can enter `users/{UID},admins/{UID}`.

  - param: RTDB_PATHS
    type: string

    example: users/{UID},admins/{UID}
    required: false
    description: >-
      Which paths in your Realtime Database instance contain user data? Leave empty if you
      don't use Realtime Database.

      Enter the full paths, separated by commas. You can represent the User ID of the deleted user with `{UID}`.

      For example: `users/{UID},admins/{UID}`.

      Where in Google Cloud Storage do you store user data? Leave empty if you
      don't use Cloud Storage.

      Enter the full paths, separated by commas. You can represent the User ID of the deleted user with `{UID}`.
      You can use `{DEFAULT}` to represent your default bucket.

      For example, if you are using your default bucket,
      and the bucket has files with the naming scheme `{UID}-pic.png`,
      then you can enter `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png`.
      If you also have files in another bucket called `my-awesome-app-logs`,
      and that bucket has files with the naming scheme `{UID}-logs.txt`,
      then you can enter `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png,my-awesome-app-logs/{UID}-logs.txt`.
