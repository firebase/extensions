  - param: FIRESTORE_PATHS
    label: Cloud Firestore paths
    description: >-
      Which paths in your Cloud Firestore instance contain user data? Leave
      empty if you don't use Cloud Firestore.

      Enter the full paths, separated by commas. You can represent the User ID
      of the deleted user with `{UID}`.

      For example, if you have the collections `users` and `admins`, and each
      collection has documents with User ID as document IDs, then you can enter
      `users/{UID},admins/{UID}`.
    type: string
    example: users/{UID},admins/{UID}
    required: false

  - param: FIRESTORE_DELETE_MODE
    label: Cloud Firestore delete mode
    description: >-
      (Only applicable if you use the `Cloud Firestore paths` parameter.) How do
      you want to delete Cloud Firestore documents? To also delete documents in
      subcollections, set this parameter to `recursive`.
    type: select
    options:
      - label: Recursive
        value: recursive
      - label: Shallow
        value: shallow
    default: shallow

      From which Realtime Database instance do you want to delete user data?
    type: string
    example: my-instance
    validationRegex: ^([0-9a-z_.-]*)$
    validationErrorMessage: Invalid database instance
    default: ${DATABASE_INSTANCE}
    required: true

  - param: RTDB_PATHS
    label: Realtime Database paths
    description: >-
      Which paths in your Realtime Database instance contain user data? Leave
      empty if you don't use Realtime Database.

      Enter the full paths, separated by commas. You can represent the User ID
      of the deleted user with `{UID}`.

      For example: `users/{UID},admins/{UID}`.
    type: string
    example: users/{UID},admins/{UID}
    required: false

  - param: STORAGE_PATHS
    label: Cloud Storage paths
    description: >-
      Where in Google Cloud Storage do you store user data? Leave empty if you
      don't use Cloud Storage.

      Enter the full paths to files or directories in your Storage buckets,
      separated by commas. Use `{UID}` to represent the User ID of the deleted
      user, and use `{DEFAULT}` to represent your default Storage bucket.

      Here's a series of examples. To delete all the files in your default
      bucket with the file naming scheme `{UID}-pic.png`, enter
      `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png`. To also delete all the files in another bucket
      called my-app-logs with the file naming scheme `{UID}-logs.txt`, enter
      `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png,my-app-logs/{UID}-logs.txt`. To *also* delete a User
      ID-labeled directory and all its files (like `media/{UID}`), enter
      `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png,my-app-logs/{UID}-logs.txt,{DEFAULT}/media/{UID}`.
    type: string
    example: "{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png,my-awesome-app-logs/{UID}-logs.txt"
    required: false
