      Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? 
      You usually want a location close to your database or Storage bucket.
      For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection 
      guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).
    options:

  - param: FIRESTORE_PATHS
    type: string
    label: Cloud Firestore paths
    example: users/{UID},admins/{UID}
    required: false
    description: >-
      Which paths in your Cloud Firestore instance contain user data? Leave
      empty if you don't use Cloud Firestore.

      Enter the full paths, separated by commas. You can represent the User ID
      of the deleted user with `{UID}`.

      For example, if you have the collections `users` and `admins`, and each
      collection has documents with User ID as document IDs, then you can enter
      `users/{UID},admins/{UID}`.

  - param: FIRESTORE_DELETE_MODE
    type: select
    label: Cloud Firestore delete mode
    description: >-
      (Only applicable if you use the `Cloud Firestore paths` parameter.) How do
      you want to delete Cloud Firestore documents? To also delete documents in
      subcollections, set this parameter to `recursive`.
    options:
      - label: Recursive
        value: recursive
      - label: Shallow
        value: shallow
    default: shallow
    required: true

  - param: RTDB_PATHS
    type: string
    label: Realtime Database paths
    example: users/{UID},admins/{UID}
    required: false
    description: >-
      Which paths in your Realtime Database instance contain user data? Leave
      empty if you don't use Realtime Database.

      Enter the full paths, separated by commas. You can represent the User ID
      of the deleted user with `{UID}`.

      For example: `users/{UID},admins/{UID}`.

  - param: STORAGE_PATHS
    type: string
    label: Cloud Storage paths
    example: "{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png,my-awesome-app-logs/{UID}-logs.txt"
    required: false
    description: >-
      Where in Google Cloud Storage do you store user data? Leave empty if you
      don't use Cloud Storage.

      Enter the full paths to files or directories in your Storage buckets,
      separated by commas. Use `{UID}` to represent the User ID of the deleted
      user, and use `{DEFAULT}` to represent your default Storage bucket.

      Here's a series of examples. To delete all the files in your default
      bucket with the file naming scheme `{UID}-pic.png`, enter
      `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png`. To also delete all the files in another bucket
      called my-app-logs with the file naming scheme `{UID}-logs.txt`, enter
      `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png,my-app-logs/{UID}-logs.txt`. To *also* delete a User
      ID-labeled directory and all its files (like `media/{UID}`), enter
      `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png,my-app-logs/{UID}-logs.txt,{DEFAULT}/media/{UID}`.
