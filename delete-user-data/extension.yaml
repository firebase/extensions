      Which paths in your Cloud Firestore instance contain data keyed on a user
      ID? Leave empty if you don't use Cloud Firestore.

      Enter the full paths, separated by commas. Use `{UID}` as a placeholder
      for the user's UID.

      For example, if you have the collections `users` and `admins`, and each
      collection has documents with User ID as document IDs, then enter
      `users/{UID},admins/{UID}`.
    type: string
    example: users/{UID},admins/{UID}
    required: false

  - param: FIRESTORE_DELETE_MODE
    label: Cloud Firestore delete mode
    description: >-
      (Only applicable if you use the `Cloud Firestore paths` parameter.) How do
      you want to delete Cloud Firestore documents? To also delete documents in
      subcollections, set this parameter to `recursive`.

    type: string
    example: my-instance
    validationRegex: ^[^\.\$\#\]\[\/\x00-\x1F\x7F]+$
    validationErrorMessage:
      Invalid database instance. Make sure that you have entered just the
      instance ID, and not the entire database URL.
    required: false

  - param: SELECTED_DATABASE_LOCATION
    label: Realtime Database location
    description: >
      (Only applicable if you provided the `Realtime Database instance`
      parameter.) From which Realtime Database location do you want to delete
      data keyed on a user ID?

      Which paths in your Realtime Database instance contain data keyed on a
      user ID? Leave empty if you don't use Realtime Database.

      Enter the full paths, separated by commas. Use `{UID}` as a placeholder
      for the user's UID.

    validationRegex: ^([0-9a-z_.-]*)$
    validationErrorMessage: Invalid storage bucket
    default: ${STORAGE_BUCKET}
    required: true

  - param: STORAGE_PATHS
    label: Cloud Storage paths
    description: >-
      Where in Google Cloud Storage do you store data keyed on a user ID? Leave
      empty if you don't use Cloud Storage.

      Enter the full paths to files or directories in your Storage buckets,
      separated by commas. Use `{UID}` to represent the User ID of the deleted
      user, and use `{DEFAULT}` to represent your default Storage bucket.

      Here's a series of examples. To delete all the files in your default
      bucket with the file naming scheme `{UID}-pic.png`, enter
      `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png`. To also delete all the files in another bucket
      called my-app-logs with the file naming scheme `{UID}-logs.txt`, enter
      `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png,my-app-logs/{UID}-logs.txt`. To *also* delete a
      User ID-labeled directory and all its files (like `media/{UID}`), enter
      `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png,my-app-logs/{UID}-logs.txt,{DEFAULT}/media/{UID}`.

  - param: AUTO_DISCOVERY_SEARCH_DEPTH
    label: Auto discovery search depth
    description: >-
      If auto discovery is enabled, how deep should auto discovery find
      collections and documents. For example, setting to `1` would only discover
      root collections and documents, whereas setting to `9` would search
      sub-collections 9 levels deep. Defaults to `3`.
    validation: ^[0-9]
    type: string
    default: 3
    required: true

  - param: AUTO_DISCOVERY_SEARCH_FIELDS
    label: Auto discovery search fields
    description: >-
      If auto discovery is enabled, specify what document fields are used to
      associate the UID with the document. The extension will delete documents
      where the value for one or more of these fields matches the deleting
      user’s UID. If left empty, document fields will not be used in auto
      discovery.
    type: string
    default: "id,uid,userId"
    required: false

  - param: SEARCH_FUNCTION
    label: Search function URL
    description: >-

      endpoint specified should return an array of firestore paths to delete.
