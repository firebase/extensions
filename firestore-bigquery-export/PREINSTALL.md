Use this extension to export the documents in a Cloud Firestore collection to BigQuery. Exports are realtime and incremental, so the data in BigQuery is a mirror of your content in Cloud Firestore.

The extension creates and updates a [dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets-intro) containing the following two BigQuery resources:

- A [table](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tables-intro) of raw data that stores a full change history of the documents within your collection. This table includes a number of metadata fields so that BigQuery can display the current state of your data. The principle metadata fields are `timestamp`, `document_name`, and the `operation` for the document change.
- A [view](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/views-intro) which represents the current state of the data within your collection. It also shows a log of the latest `operation` for each document (`CREATE`, `UPDATE`, or `IMPORT`).

If you create, update, delete, or import a document in the specified collection, this extension sends that update to BigQuery. You can then run queries on this mirrored dataset.

Note that this extension only listens for _document_ changes in the collection, but not changes in any _subcollection_. You can, though, install additional instances of this extension to specifically listen to a subcollection or other collections in your database. Or if you have the same subcollection across documents in a given collection, you can use `{wildcard}` notation to listen to all those subcollections (for example: `chats/{chatid}/posts`). 

Enabling wildcard references will provide an additional STRING based column. The resulting JSON field value references any wildcards that are included in ${param:COLLECTION_PATH}. You can extract them using [JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions#json_extract_scalar).


`Partition` settings cannot be updated on a pre-existing table, if these options are required then a new table must be created.

`Clustering` will not need to create or modify a table when adding clustering options, this will be updated automatically.



#### Additional setup

Before installing this extension, you'll need to:

- [Set up Cloud Firestore in your Firebase project.](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart)
- [Link your Firebase project to BigQuery.](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318765)

#### Transform function

Prior to sending the document change to BigQuery, you have an opportunity to transform the data with an HTTP function. The payload will contain the following:

```
{ 
  data: [{
    insertId: int;
    json: {
      timestamp: int;
      event_id: int;
      document_name: string;
      document_id: int;
      operation: ChangeType;
      data: string;
    },
  }]
}
```

The response should be indentical in structure.

#### Backfill your BigQuery dataset

This extension only sends the content of documents that have been changed -- it does not export your full dataset of existing documents into BigQuery. So, to backfill your BigQuery dataset with all the documents in your collection, you can run the [import script](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-bigquery-export/guides/IMPORT_EXISTING_DOCUMENTS.md) provided by this extension.

**Important:** Run the import script over the entire collection _after_ installing this extension, otherwise all writes to your database during the import might be lost.

#### Generate schema views

After your data is in BigQuery, you can run the [schema-views script](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-bigquery-export/guides/GENERATE_SCHEMA_VIEWS.md) (provided by this extension) to create views that make it easier to query relevant data. You only need to provide a JSON schema file that describes your data structure, and the schema-views script will create the views.

#### Billing
 
To install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)
 
- You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).
- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the serviceâ€™s no-cost tier:
  - BigQuery (this extension writes to BigQuery with [streaming inserts](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#streaming_pricing))
  - Cloud Firestore
  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))
