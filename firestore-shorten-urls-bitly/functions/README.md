# Shorten URLs

**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)

**Description**: Shortens URLs written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection (uses Bitly).



**Details**: Use this extension to create shortened URLs from URLs written to Cloud Firestore. These shortened URLs are useful as display URLs.

This extension listens to your specified Cloud Firestore collection. If you add a URL to a specified field in any document within that collection, this extension:

- Shortens the URL.
- Saves the shortened URL in a new specified field in the same document.

If the original URL in a document is updated, then the shortened URL will be automatically updated, too.

This extension uses Bitly to shorten URLs, so you'll need to supply your Bitly access token as part of this extension's installation. You can generate this access token using [Bitly](https://bitly.com/a/oauth_apps).
