params:
  - param: IMG_BUCKET
    label: Cloud Storage bucket for images
    description: >
      To which Cloud Storage bucket will you upload images that you want to
      resize? Resized images will be stored in this bucket. Depending on your
      extension configuration, original images are either kept or deleted. It is
      recommended to create a separate bucket for this extension. For more
      information, refer to the [pre-installation
      guide](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/storage-resize-images).
    type: selectResource
    resourceType: storage.googleapis.com/Bucket
    example: my-project-12345.appspot.com
    validationRegex: ^([0-9a-z_.-]*)$
    validationErrorMessage: Invalid storage bucket
    default: ${STORAGE_BUCKET}
    required: true

  - param: IMG_SIZES
    label: Sizes of resized images
    description: >
      What sizes of images would you like (in pixels)? Enter the sizes as a
      comma-separated list of WIDTHxHEIGHT values. Learn more about [how this
      parameter
      works](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/storage-resize-images).
    type: string
    example: "200x200"
    validationRegex: ^\d+x(\d+,\d+x)*\d+$
    validationErrorMessage:
      Invalid sizes, must be a comma-separated list of WIDTHxHEIGHT values.
    default: "200x200"
    required: true

  - param: DELETE_ORIGINAL_FILE
    label: Deletion of original file
    description: >-
      Do you want to automatically delete the original file from the Cloud
      Storage bucket? Warning: these deletions cannot be undone, and if you
      reconfigure this instance to use different image dimensions, you won't be
      able to backfill deleted images.
    type: select
    options:
      - label: Don't delete
        value: false
      - label: Delete on any resize attempt
        value: true
      - label: Delete only on successful resize attempts
        value: on_success
    default: false
    required: true

  - param: MAKE_PUBLIC
    label: Make resized images public
    description: >-
      Do you want to make the resized images public automatically? So you can
      access them by URL. For example:
      https://storage.googleapis.com/{bucket}/{path}
    type: select
    options:
      - label: Yes
        value: true
      - label: No
        value: false
    default: false

  - param: RESIZED_IMAGES_PATH
    label: Cloud Storage path for resized images
    description: >
      A relative path in which to store resized images. For example, if you
      specify a path here of `thumbs` and you upload an image to
      `/images/original.jpg`, then the resized image is stored at
      `/images/thumbs/original_200x200.jpg`. If you prefer to store resized
      images at the root of your bucket, leave this field empty.
    example: thumbnails
    required: false

  - param: INCLUDE_PATH_LIST
    label: Paths that contain images you want to resize
    description: >
      Restrict storage-resize-images to only resize images in specific locations
      in your Storage bucket by  supplying a comma-separated list of absolute
      paths. For example, specifying the paths
      `/users/pictures,/restaurants/menuItems` will resize any images found in
      any subdirectories of `/users/pictures` and `/restaurants/menuItems`.

      You may also use wildcard notation for directories in the path. For
      example, `/users/*/pictures` would include any images in any
      subdirectories of `/users/foo/pictures` as well as any images in
      subdirectories of `/users/bar/pictures`, but also any images in
      subdirectories of `/users/any/level/of/subdirectories/pictures`. 

      If you prefer not to explicitly restrict to certain directories of your
      Storage bucket, leave this field empty.
    type: string
    example: "/users/avatars,/design/pictures"
    validationRegex: ^(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+(\,(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+)*$
    validationErrorMessage:
      Invalid paths, must be a comma-separated list of absolute path values.
    required: false

  - param: EXCLUDE_PATH_LIST
    label: List of absolute paths not included for resized images
    description: >
      Ensure storage-resize-images does *not* resize images in _specific
      locations_ in your Storage bucket by  supplying a comma-separated list of
      absolute paths. For example, to *exclude* the images  stored in the
      `/foo/alpha` and its subdirectories and `/bar/beta` and its
      subdirectories, specify the paths `/foo/alpha,/bar/beta`.

      You may also use wildcard notation for directories in the path. For
      example, `/users/*/pictures` would exclude any images in any
      subdirectories of `/users/foo/pictures` as well as any images in
      subdirectories of `/users/bar/pictures`, but also any images in
      subdirectories of `/users/any/level/of/subdirectories/pictures`.

      If you prefer to resize every image uploaded to your Storage bucket, leave
      this field empty.
    type: string
    example: "/users/avatars/thumbs,/design/pictures/thumbs"
    validationRegex: ^(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+(\,(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+)*$
    validationErrorMessage:
      Invalid paths, must be a comma-separated list of absolute path values.
    required: false

  - param: FAILED_IMAGES_PATH
    label: Cloud Storage path for failed images
    description: >
      A relative path in which to store failed images. For example, if you
      specify a path here of `failed` and you upload an image to
      `/images/original.jpg`, then resizing failed, the image will be stored at
      `/images/failed/original.jpg`.

      Leave this field empty if you do not want to store failed images in a
      separate directory.
    example: failed
    validationRegex: ^([^\/.]*|)$

    validationErrorMessage: Values cannot include "/", ".".
    required: false

  - param: CACHE_CONTROL_HEADER
    label: Cache-Control header for resized images
    description: >
      This extension automatically copies any `Cache-Control` metadata from the
      original image to the resized images. For the resized images, do you want
      to overwrite this copied `Cache-Control` metadata or add `Cache-Control`
      metadata? Learn more about [`Cache-Control`
      headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control).
      If you prefer not to overwrite or add `Cache-Control` metadata, leave this
      field empty.
    example: max-age=86400
    required: false

  - param: IMAGE_TYPE
    label: Convert image to preferred types
    description: >
      The image types you'd like your source image to convert to.  The default
      for this option will be to keep the original file type as the destination
      file type.
    type: multiSelect
    options:
      - label: jpeg
        value: jpeg
      - label: webp

        value: avif
      - label: original
        value: false
    default: false
    required: true

  - param: OUTPUT_OPTIONS
    label: Output options for selected formats
    description: >
      Provide an optional output option as a stringified object containing Sharp
      Output Options for selected image types conversion. eg. `{"jpeg": {
      "quality": 5, "chromaSubsampling": "4:4:4" }, "png": { "palette": true }}`
      and `{"png":{"compressionLevel":9}}`. The `"compressionLevel": 9`
      specifies the level of compression for PNG images. Higher numbers here
      indicate greater compression, leading to smaller file sizes at the cost of
      potentially increased processing time and possible loss of image quality.
    type: string
    validationRegex: ^({(.*?)})$
    validationErrorMessage: Please provide a valid JSON object.
    required: false

  - param: SHARP_OPTIONS
    label: Sharp constructor options for resizing images
    description: >
      Provide an optional stringified Sharp ResizeOptions object to customize
      resizing behavior, eg. `{ "fastShrinkOnLoad": false, "position": “centre”,
      "fit": "inside" }` The `"fit": "inside"` option ensures the image fits
      within given dimensions, maintaining aspect ratio, scaling down as needed
      without cropping or distortion. Learn more about [`Sharp constructor
      options`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-resize#resize).
    type: string
    validationRegex: ^({(.*?)})$
    validationErrorMessage: Please provide a valid JSON object.
