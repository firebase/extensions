  - param: IMG_BUCKET
    label: Cloud Storage bucket for images
    description: >
      To which Cloud Storage bucket will you upload images that you want to resize?
      Resized images will be stored in this bucket. Depending on your extension configuration,
      original images are either kept or deleted.
      It is recommended to create a separate bucket for this extension. For more information,
      refer to the [pre-installation guide](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/storage-resize-images).
    type: selectResource
    resourceType: storage.googleapis.com/Bucket
    example: my-project-12345.appspot.com
    validationRegex: ^([0-9a-z_.-]*)$
    validationErrorMessage: Invalid storage bucket
    default: ${STORAGE_BUCKET}
    required: true

  - param: IMG_SIZES
    label: Sizes of resized images
    description: >
      What sizes of images would you like (in pixels)? Enter the sizes as a
      comma-separated list of WIDTHxHEIGHT values. Learn more about
      [how this parameter works](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/storage-resize-images).
    type: string
    example: "200x200"
    validationRegex: ^\d+x(\d+,\d+x)*\d+$
    validationErrorMessage:
      Invalid sizes, must be a comma-separated list of WIDTHxHEIGHT values.
    default: "200x200"
    required: true

  - param: DELETE_ORIGINAL_FILE
    label: Deletion of original file
    description: >-
      Do you want to automatically delete the original file from the Cloud Storage
      bucket? Warning: these deletions cannot be undone, and if you reconfigure this
      instance to use different image dimensions, you won't be able to backfill deleted images.
    type: select
    options:
      - label: Don't delete
        value: false
      - label: Delete on any resize attempt
        value: true
      - label: Delete only on successful resize attempts
        value: on_success
    default: false
    required: true

  - param: MAKE_PUBLIC
    label: Make resized images public
    description: >-
      Do you want to make the resized images public automatically? So you can access them by URL.
      For example: https://storage.googleapis.com/{bucket}/{path}
    type: select
    options:
      - label: Yes
        value: true
      - label: No
        value: false
    default: false

  - param: RESIZED_IMAGES_PATH
    label: Cloud Storage path for resized images
    description: >
      A relative path in which to store resized images. For example,
      if you specify a path here of `thumbs` and you upload an image to
      `/images/original.jpg`, then the resized image is stored at
      `/images/thumbs/original_200x200.jpg`. If you prefer to store resized
      images at the root of your bucket, leave this field empty.
    example: thumbnails
    required: false

  - param: INCLUDE_PATH_LIST
    label: Paths that contain images you want to resize
    description: >
      Restrict storage-resize-images to only resize images in specific locations in your Storage bucket by 
      supplying a comma-separated list of absolute paths. For example, to only resize the images 
      stored in the `/users/pictures` and `/restaurants/menuItems` directories, specify the paths `/users/pictures,/restaurants/menuItems`.
      
      You may also use wildcard notation for directories in the path. For example, `/users/*/pictures` 
      would match `/users/profile/pictures/image.png` as well as  `/users/profile/pictures/any/sub/directory/image.png`. 
      
      If you prefer to resize every image uploaded to your Storage bucket, 
      leave this field empty.
    type: string
    example: "/users/avatars,/design/pictures"
    validationRegex: ^(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+(\,(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+)*$
    validationErrorMessage:
      Invalid paths, must be a comma-separated list of absolute path values.
    required: false

  - param: EXCLUDE_PATH_LIST
    label: List of absolute paths not included for resized images
    description: >
      Ensure storage-resize-images does *not* resize images in _specific locations_ in your Storage bucket by 
      supplying a comma-separated list of absolute paths. For example, to *exclude* the images 
      stored in the `/users/pictures` and `/restaurants/menuItems` directories, specify the paths `/users/pictures,/restaurants/menuItems`.
      
      You may also use wildcard notation for directories in the path. For example, `/users/*/pictures` 
      would exclude `/users/profile/pictures/image.png` as well as `/users/profile/pictures/any/sub/directory/image.png`. 
      
      If you prefer to resize every image uploaded to your Storage bucket, 
      leave this field empty.
    type: string
    example: "/users/avatars/thumbs,/design/pictures/thumbs"
    validationRegex: ^(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+(\,(\/[^\s\/\,]+)+)*$
    validationErrorMessage:
      Invalid paths, must be a comma-separated list of absolute path values.
    required: false

  - param: CACHE_CONTROL_HEADER
    label: Cache-Control header for resized images
    description: >
      This extension automatically copies any `Cache-Control` metadata from the original image
      to the resized images. For the resized images, do you want to overwrite this copied
      `Cache-Control` metadata or add `Cache-Control` metadata? Learn more about
      [`Cache-Control` headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control).
      If you prefer not to overwrite or add `Cache-Control` metadata, leave this field empty.
    example: max-age=86400
    required: false

  - param: IMAGE_TYPE
    label: Convert image to preferred types
