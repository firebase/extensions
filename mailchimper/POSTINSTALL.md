Whenever a new user is added your app, this mod adds the user's email address to your Mailchimp list.

Also, if the user deletes their user account for your app, this mod removes the user from the Mailchimp list.

As a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/mods/manage-installed-mods#monitor) of your installed mod, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.
