The Mod will listen to a Cloud Firestore Collection and translate text added to a specific field in each Document.

When installing the mod, you are able to choose a list of languages that you would like the text translated into. You will need to use ISO-639-1 language codes when specifying the target languages. A list of valid languages and their corresponding codes can be found in the
[Cloud Translate official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages).

The Mod will automatically detect the source language of the entered text and translate it into the languages you have chosen.
