Use this extension to track user presence in a Cloud Firestore collection.

## Introduction
Whenever a user is logged in using `SessionManager` provided by the SDK, the user's presence information is written to RTDB. The resulting RTDB document is mirrored to a Firestore collection using Cloud Functions for Firebase. Each authenticated user will have a document within the Firestore collection (keyed by their Firebase Authentication uuid) that contains two fields relevant to their active connections. The `sessions` field is a map of all active user connections (keyed by `sessionID`, see "User Connections" below). If metadata is set using the SDK, they can be found under `sessions/sessionID` (See "Custom Metadata"). The `last_updated` field contains timestamps of when a `sessionID` was last updated in RTDB.
 
 When a user disconnects, RTDB's `OnDisconnect` function fires and the relevant connection (`sessionID`) and its metadata are removed from RTDB and Firestore. A user is considered offline if the `sessions` map is empty in Firestore.

## Custom Metadata
Custom metadata can be set using the `setMetatdata` function from the SDK. The metadata can be any JSON object with a few exceptions (see warning below). Setting metadata will store the information within the `sessions/sessionID` of the user's Firestore document. It's important to note that this `sessionID` may change due to unintentional disconnects/reconnects (see "User Connections"). 

> Warning: custom metadata can not contain nested arrays which are not valid fields in Firestore.

## User Connections
The extension is capable of tracking multiple connections (each with a unique `sessionID` auto-generated by the SDK) for individual users. Thus it is possible to store different metadata per connection and count the number of active connections per user. However, it is **not recommended** to utilize the `sessionID` for business logic because they are **transient**. Any unintentional disconnects/reconnects will remove the previous connection and assign the user a new `sessionID` on reconnect. Custom metadata will persist to the new connection by the client SDK, but a new `sessionID` will be assigned.

## Parameters
You will need to specify the target collection in Firestore where the presence information will be stored. The extension provides a default document path for data in RTDB, but you may specify a custom path.
